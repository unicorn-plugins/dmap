DMAP Skill Activation Paths technical diagram.

Top: "User Request" starting point

Two branching paths:

Left path "Direct Activation":
- User → "Slash command or clear natural language" → Runtime direct match → Specific skill activation
- Example: "/abra:scenario" → Execute scenario skill directly
- Blue solid arrow

Right path "Core-mediated Activation":
- User → "Ambiguous request" → Runtime → Core skill activation → Intent detection → Route to appropriate skill
- Example: "Create an agent" → Core → Full workflow skill
- Orange dotted arrow

Bottom: 5 skill types arranged side by side
- Core (purple) — "Behavior norms + routing"
- Setup (green) — "Installation/configuration (direct type)"
- Planning (blue) — "Planning establishment"
- Orchestrator (orange) — "Workflow orchestration"
- Utility (gray) — "Auxiliary functions (direct type)"

Delegating types (Core, Planning, Orchestrator) have solid borders
Direct types (Setup, Utility) have dotted borders

Style: Flowchart style, clean flat design, pastel colors, English text. White background.
