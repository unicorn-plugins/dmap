Clean technical diagram showing layered structure based on Clean Architecture pattern.

Components (flowing top to bottom in layer structure):
1. Top layer: "User Request" (Input) — enters via blue arrow
2. Second layer: "Skills (Controller)" — routing + orchestration, light purple box
   - Delegating skills: Core, Planning, Orchestrator
   - Direct skills: Setup, Utility
3. Third layer: "Agents (Service)" — autonomous expert execution, light blue box
   - Role-based icons for architect, executor, explorer, etc.
4. Fourth layer: "Gateway" — abstract→concrete mapping, light green box
   - Shows runtime-mapping.yaml
5. Bottom layer: "Runtime" — execution environment, light gray box
   - Logos for Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.
6. On the right side: "Resource Marketplace" — shared resource pool, light yellow separate box
   - Guides, templates, samples, tools

Arrows: Skills → Agents → Gateway → Runtime (unidirectional dependency)
Direct skills bypass Agents with dotted lines, connecting directly to Gateway

Style: Clean flat design, rounded corner boxes, thin connecting lines, bright pastel colors.
Use English text. White background.
